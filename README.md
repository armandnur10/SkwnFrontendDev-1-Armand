# SEKAWAN MEDIA TEST FURNITURE

Demo : https://sekawan-furniture.netlify.app/

## Tools

In this project there are tools that I use:

- [Vs Code] - a complete and reliable multiplatform text editor made by Microsoft
- [Swiper js] - library that creates modern touch sliders with hardware-accelerated transitions (utilizing GPU to offload graphic-intensive transitions and create smoother visuals) and excellent native behavior.
- [vanila css] -  a utility class-based and customizable SASS library
- [fontawesome icons] -  a growing library of SVG icons and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less.
